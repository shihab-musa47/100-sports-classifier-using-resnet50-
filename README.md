# 100 Sports Classifier using ResNet50

This project implements a sports image classifier using the ResNet50 deep learning model. The classifier is trained to recognize and categorize images from 100 different sports.

## Features

- Utilizes ResNet50 pre-trained model for image classification
- Supports classification of 100 sports categories
- Built with Python and TensorFlow/PyTorch

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/100-sports-classifier-using-resnet50.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset of sports images.
2. Train the model:
   ```
